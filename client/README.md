# Client

This folder contains all code for the client side of this project. 

## Installation

To install all client-side libraries and dependencies, run the following command 
while standing in the "client" folder. 

 ```bash
npm install
```

This is the only command that the average user will ever need to use in this folder. 
All other relevant commands are found and run at the project root.

## Start the client

The avarage user should ignore this section as the client is started from the 
root when the project is run normaly. For instructions on how to start the client 
from the root, look in the README.md in the /project folder.

The client can be started on its own (without the server) using the following 
command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Observe that the webpage will not work as intended if the client is started without the server.
